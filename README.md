# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
## Ammar Owaineh
This project aims to analyze a dataset of sales of items of various types in multiple stores in order to predict patterns of future sales. 
In the first two parts of the project, the repository was created to load any relevant files and the data was cleaned by removing duplicate cells and adding placeholders to missing cells as appropriate. 
In the third part of the project, data visualization tools were used to identify and significant features and properties of the data and to look for patterns that may be useful to achieve the goal of the project. 
As part of the analysis, it was noted that while plotting the Item Visibility and Item Outlet Sales columns, there was a significant number of outlers in both categories as shown below:

The plots show a high number of extreme values outside the interquartile range, which indicates a skew in the data, making it potentially harder to predict in these categories. However, it should be noted that these indications are preliminary and further thorough investigation of the date is needed to determine their significance. 

Another finding in the visualized data shows that both small and medium outlets have higher sale numbers than larger-sized outlets as highlighted below:

The data also shows that supermarkets categorized as "Type 1" have almost five times the sales of other types included in the data ("Type 2," "Type 3," and "Grocery Store") as illustrated in the below plot:

Both the above illustrations toghether indicate that small and medium sized "Type" supermarkets would have the highest sale numbers. 

In the coming parts of the project the data will be further analyzed to confirm or deny these findings. Moreoever, the project will delve deeper into the data and continue with more detailed and comprehensive analysis.
